    <string name="index">\t\t\t\tŚrīla Vyāsadeva as the compiler of the Vedic literatures is a post, just as Lord Brahmā, Indra, Sūrya etc. are also posts that are held by different personalities at different times. The Viṣṇu Purāṇa (3.3.11–19) gives a list of twenty-eight persons who act as Vyāsa for the twenty-eight Dvāpara-yugas which have passed in the current Vaivasvata-manvantara. The last in the list is Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana Vyāsa who is described in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: “Thereafter, in the seventeenth incarnation of Godhead, Śrī Vyāsadeva appeared in the womb of Satyavatī through Parāśara Muni, and he divided the one Veda into several branches and subbranches, seeing that the people in general were less intelligent.” (ŚB 1.3.21)\n\n\t\t\t\tAs he occupies the post of the compiler of the Vedic literatures, Śrī Vyāsadeva is generally categorized as a śaktyāveśa-avatāra, an exalted jīva empowered by the Lord with portions of His powers such as knowledge. In the yugas previous to the last Dvāpara-yuga some of the personalities who acted in the post of Vyāsa were: Brahmā, Manu, Bṛhaspati, Indra, Yama, Bharadvāja, Gautama, Dhanañjaya, Parāśara and others. In the next Dvāpara-yuga Drauṇi, the son of Droṇa (Aśvatthāmā) will become Vyāsa. All these personalities are especially empowered jīvas.</string>

    <string name="preface">\t\t\t\t\tWe must know the present need of human society. And what is that need? Human society is no longer bounded by geographical limits to particular countries or communities. Human society is broader than in the Middle Ages, and the world tendency is toward one state or one human society. The ideals of spiritual communism, according to Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, are based more or less on the oneness of the entire human society, nay, of the entire energy of living beings. The need is felt by great thinkers to make this a successful ideology. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam will fill this need in human society. It begins, therefore, with the aphorism of Vedānta philosophy janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1] to establish the ideal of a common cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t Human society, at the present moment, is not in the darkness of oblivion. It has made rapid progress in the field of material comforts, education and economic development throughout the entire world. But there is a pinprick somewhere in the social body at large, and therefore there are large-scale quarrels, even over less important issues. There is need of a clue as to how humanity can become one in peace, friendship and prosperity with a common cause. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam will fill this need, for it is a cultural presentation for the respiritualization of the entire human society.\n\t\t\t\t\t Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam should be introduced also in the schools and colleges, for it is recommended by the great student-devotee Prahlāda Mahārāja in order to change the demoniac face of society.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t kaumāra ācaret prājñodharmān bhāgavatān ihadurlabhaṁ mānuṣaṁ janmatad apy adhruvam arthadam (Bhāg. 7.6.1) \n\n\t\t\t\t\tDisparity in human society is due to lack of principles in a godless civilization. There is God, or the Almighty One, from whom everything emanates, by whom everything is maintained and in whom everything is merged to rest. Material science has tried to find the ultimate source of creation very insufficiently, but it is a fact that there is one ultimate source of everything that be. This ultimate source is explained rationally and authoritatively in the beautiful Bhāgavatam, or Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\n\t\t\t\t\tŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam is the transcendental science not only for knowing the ultimate source of everything but also for knowing our relation with Him and our duty toward perfection of the human society on the basis of this perfect knowledge. It is powerful reading matter in the Sanskrit language, and it is now rendered into English elaborately so that simply by a careful reading one will know God perfectly well, so much so that the reader will be sufficiently educated to defend himself from the onslaught of atheists. Over and above this, the reader will be able to convert others to accepting God as a concrete principle.\n\t\t\t\t\tŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam begins with the definition of the ultimate source. It is a bona fide commentary on the Vedānta-sūtra by the same author, Śrīla Vyāsadeva, and gradually it develops into nine cantos up to the highest state of God realization. The only qualification one needs to study this great book of transcendental knowledge is to proceed step by step cautiously and not jump forward haphazardly like with an ordinary book. It should be gone through chapter by chapter, one after another. The reading matter is so arranged with its original Sanskrit text, its English transliteration, synonyms, translation and purports so that one is sure to become a God-realized soul at the end of finishing the first nine cantos.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Tenth Canto is distinct from the first nine cantos because it deals directly with the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa. One will be unable to capture the effects of the Tenth Canto without going through the first nine cantos. The book is complete in twelve cantos, each independent, but it is good for all to read them in small installments one after another.\n\t\t\t\t\t I must admit my frailties in presenting Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, but still I am hopeful of its good reception by the thinkers and leaders of society on the strength of the following statement of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (1.5.11):\n\n\t\t\t\t\ttad-vāg-visargo janatāgha-viplavo\n\t\t\t\t\tyasmin prati-ślokam abaddhavaty api\n\t\t\t\t\tnāmāny anantasya yaśo \'ńkitāni yac\n\t\t\t\t\tchṛṇvanti gāyanti gṛṇanti sādhavaḥ\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn the other hand, that literature which is full with descriptions of the transcendental glories of the name, fame, form and pastimes of the unlimited Supreme Lord is a transcendental creation meant to bring about a revolution in the impious life of a misdirected civilization. Such transcendental literatures, even though irregularly composed, are heard, sung and accepted by purified men who are thoroughly honest.\n\n\n\n\n.</string>
